<h2>Description</h2>
My background experience has a focus on managing, designing or developing SaaS and PaaS products or project features with freelance design experience creating modern UI expereinces. I've worked with startups, major corporate enterprises and small local businesses satisfying stakeholders and reaching roadmap goals with proven results.

<br>
<br>
I am exceptionally good at software project management from being a team player and supporting members during tight bottleneck sprints helping consistently optimize and adapt to the work-process, managing workflow collaboratively. By takeing pride in being a team player and focusing on communication, organization, planning, following through with strategy, holding people accountable, I have delivered results with accuracy and reliability over and over again always looking for feedback and ways I can grow. I work best with High-Level Managers and Developers by briding the gap between technicality developers communicate with and breaking it down in generality. Products or projects I've work on pertain to software-engineering, cyber-security, cloud-computing, business-operations and marketing.
