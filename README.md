<h2 color="blue">Background</h2>

<h3>Bachelors of Science in Business Information Systems</h3>

<p>In January 2021, I began my professional journey as an Project Lead Developer working with my universities branch of the Association of Information Technology Professioanls AITP group. While in this role I lead our team in designing, developing and proto-typing of a custom application UI and UX, specialized content and documentation that met the requirements of our shareholders. This project was vital for eldery individuals as they had no means of getting vaccinated so we rushed development in an agile manner staying up all night to beat the state of Connecticut in creating a Covid-19 vaccination web application that would help walk the elderly and anyone get vaccinated in a clear and concise manner being featured across several major news agencies.</p>

<p>In May of 2021, I proudly earned a distinguished bachelor's degree in Business-Information-Systems, magnifying my technology prowess, deepening my business understanding of information technology, and fostering an unwavering commitment to leadership, analytical thinking, business intelligence, data analysis, project management, and collaborative teamwork. This transformative educational journey holds immense value, representing my unwavering dedication and a solid foundation for success in the professional realm.</p>

<p>Days after graduating I began working in a Full-Time role as Marketing Technology Specialist for a large sized law-firm learning about maintaining medium-sized CRM's, developing complex SEO competitive analysis reports, using Jira as well as project management tools and guiding the company towards implementing a new CMS. For about 6-months this role was interesting but after about the 8-month, I knew I need to migrate roles into something more technical or developer-friendly.</p>

<p>From 2022 to 2023, I undertook two distinct contracts as a Technical Project Consultant, contributing to a startup venture backed by Arcline Investments. Collaborating alongside industry-leading technology professionals, my focus centered on the development of bespoke industrial ERP systems and mobile applications tailored specifically for elevator companies throughout the United States. In my subsequent role, I immersed myself further within the industrial sector at Comcast, where I orchestrated the coordination of telecom infrastructure projects with renowned organizations. Leveraging widely recognized SaaS technologies such as the National Joint Utilities Notification System (NJUNS) and the AldenOne System, I navigated the intricacies of the industry with precision. During my tenure, I facilitated the enhancement of joint ventures, streamlined processes through automation, and consistently provided comprehensive status reports to senior management to ensure the seamless progression of projects.</p>

<p>In 2023, I have successfully achieved and currently possess the esteemed AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, affirming my comprehensive grasp of cloud technologies and their pragmatic application. As an independent developer, I actively work on various projects using technologies like the React Native, Tailwinds, MERN stack, Vite, MySQL, NoSQL, and AWS services. Continually improving and expanding my skill set, I pursue certifications and courses to stay up to date with industry standards. My GitHub repository showcases the projects I've undertaken, demonstrating my hands-on experience, problem-solving abilities, and growth as a developer. I specialize in building Full-Stack web applications that integrate NoSQL, MySQL, and cloud technologies. </p>
